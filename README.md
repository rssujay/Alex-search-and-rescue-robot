# CG1112-Search-and-Rescue

A project involving mapping of an unknown, simulated hazardous environment using a tele-operated robot. 

This project makes use of a LIDAR device running a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, 
mounted on top of a mobile robot setup consisting of a raspberry Pi 3B+, an Arduino Uno and various subsystems 
driven by the two computational devices. The entire system is remotely controllable from a laptop.
